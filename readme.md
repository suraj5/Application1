# Android Tic-Tac-Toe

#### The Challenge:
Build an Android app that reproduces the game [Tic-Tac-Toe]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe.

#### What To Do:
Create a single screen app that lets a user player a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.  The app should be able to play against the user.  How good the app is at playing is up to you.

Be as creative as you like with the user interface, but keep Android design principles and best practices in mind.

#### Ready To Code?

####Hello, 
This is Sree Harsha Mamilla and this is my Tic Tac Toe
native android application.

The application was developed with keeping in mind the good design
principles of UI. The application seemlessly orients to potrait
and landscape and scales the UI appropriately.

The AI part used is basic brute force. Hopefully the next version
would made abit more smarter by using Min Max algorithm.

Thanks you.

Regards,
Sree
